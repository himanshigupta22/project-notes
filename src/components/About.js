                        <p>
                            We are trying to bridge the gap between students by creating a central hub for notes and study resources.
                            Our aim is to encourage peer-to-peer learning, where students can help each other by sharing their insights, summaries, and lecture notes.
                            We believe that learning is better together, and by building this platform, we hope to make education more accessible, supportive, and community-driven.</p>
